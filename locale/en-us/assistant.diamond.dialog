Machine 2 is running nominally, no further action is required
Machine 4 has been running for 45 hours 11 minutes
I recommend performing a thorough inspection of machine 8 tomorrow. there may be something wrong with the solenoids.
There is a 10% chance that the oil pump will fail on machine 5 tomorrow. i recommend replacing it within 3 days.
